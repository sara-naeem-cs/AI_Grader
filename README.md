Grading can be time-consuming, and the grades given can sometimes be influenced by factors like mood, fatigue, or implicit bias. To help address this, I built an AI grader that provides more consistent and objective evaluations.

The AI grader takes in a rubric file (even in table form) and an assignment file, then returns a detailed score breakdown, clear reasoning for the feedback, and actionable suggestions for improvement.
