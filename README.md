# AI Grader

Grading can be time-consuming, and evaluation outcomes may sometimes be influenced by factors such as mood, fatigue, or implicit bias.

To help address this, I built an **AI Grader** that provides consistent, rubric-based evaluations. It also allows students to evaluate their work against a rubric before submission, helping them improve their assignments in advance.
